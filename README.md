# Bromberg-Shpilrain-Vdovina SL₂ Homomorphic Hashing

This is a pure-Rust implementation of the Tillich-Zémor-style hash
function presented in the paper ["Navigating in the Cayley Graph of
SL₂(𝔽ₚ)"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00233-015-9766-5)
by Bromberg, Shpilrain, and Vdovina.

# What is this library for?

This library implements a putatively-strong hash function H with the
useful property that it gives a monoid homomorphism. This means there
is a cheap operation `*` such that given strings `s1` and `s2`,
`H(s1 ++ s2) = H(s1) * H(s2)`.

This property is especially useful for applications where some very
long string may be constructed via many different routes, but you'd
nonetheless like to be able to quickly rule out unequal strings.

It also allows you to hash _parts_ of your data as you acquire them,
and then merge them later in whatever order is convenient. This allows
for very flexible hashing schemes.

H has some other cool properties, and is in some limited but
potentially-useful sense "provably secure". See Bromberg et al. for
details.

# How to use this library

This library provides the means to construct `HashMatrix`es, using
implementations of `BrombergHashable`. These hashes can be compared,
or serialized to hex strings using `to_hex`.

```
use bromberg_sl2::*;
assert_eq!("hello, world!".bromberg_hash().to_hex(),
  "21fe256b03546bdbc5b1c879d47ff7363df56837eb1782ebbc4bb3f9247a4ddb40679d4b5f4a057767f7147e252e4f5b0fa5");
```

Hashes may also be composed, using the `*` operator:

```
use bromberg_sl2::*;
assert_eq!(
  "hello, ".bromberg_hash() * "world!".bromberg_hash(),
  "hello, world!".bromberg_hash()
);
```

# Technical Details

We use the A(2) and B(2) matrices as generators of SL₂, and
p = 2^127 - 1 as our prime order, for fast modular arithmetic.

We have not yet attempted to seriously optimize this library at all,
and performance is a secondary goal. As of right now our procedure is
about 1/6 as fast as SHA3-512. We needed an architecture-agnostic
cryptographic hash procedure with a monoid homomorphism respecting
string concatenation, written in a low-level language. While there are
[a](https://github.com/srijs/hwsl2-core)
[few](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/tzhash)
[implementations](https://github.com/phlegmaticprogrammer/tillich_zemor_hash)
of related algorithms, e.g. the venerable [but broken
](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19574-7_20) Tillich-Zémor hash,
from ["Hashing with SL₂"
](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48658-5_5),
none of them fulfill the above desiderata.
